# Icons Assets

This folder contains all the icon assets used throughout the project. These icons enhance the visual elements of the application, providing both decorative and functional value.

## Contents

- **SVG Icons:** Scalable vector graphics that maintain clarity at any resolution.
- **Raster Icons:** Bitmap images (PNG, JPG) used in specific cases.
- **Other Formats:** Any additional file formats as required by the project.

## Folder Organization

Icons are organized into subfolders based on their usage or category. Common subfolders include:

- **actions/**: Icons representing actions (e.g., `edit.svg`, `delete.svg`).
- **navigation/**: Icons used in navigation elements (e.g., `menu.svg`, `home.svg`).
- **social/**: Icons for social media platforms.
- **misc/**: Icons that do not fit into the above categories.

> **Note:** If you're adding new icons, please follow the existing folder structure to keep the assets organized.

## Naming Conventions

- **Lowercase and Hyphenated:** File names should be in lowercase letters and use hyphens to separate words (e.g., `search-icon.svg`).
- **Descriptive Names:** Choose names that clearly describe the icon’s purpose.
- **No Spaces or Special Characters:** Avoid spaces and special characters in file names to ensure compatibility across different systems.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Scalability:** Use SVG icons wherever possible as they scale seamlessly across devices.
- **Styling:** Icons can be styled using CSS. For instance, you can change their color or size by targeting the SVG directly.
- **Fallbacks:** When using SVGs, ensure you have fallbacks (e.g., PNGs) for browsers that might not support them fully.

## Source and Licensing

- **Third-Party Icons:** If any icons were sourced from third-party libraries or websites, ensure their licenses are followed. Attribution may be required—please include any necessary credit in the main project documentation.
- **Custom Icons:** Icons designed specifically for this project are covered under the same license as the overall project unless stated otherwise.
